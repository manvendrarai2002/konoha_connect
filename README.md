## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
  - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
  - A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) account (to get your database connection URI)
  - A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account (to get your cloud name and API keys)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/fullstack-chat-app.git
    cd fullstack-chat-app
    ```

2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**

    ```shell
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

    ```shell
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

    ```env
    # Your MongoDB connection string
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...

    # Port for the backend server
    PORT=5000

    # A strong, secret key for signing JWTs
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_here

    # Your Cloudinary credentials for media uploads
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

    # Set the environment to development
    NODE_ENV=development
    ```

-----

## üèÉ Running the Application

You need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminals.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    From the `backend` directory, run:

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the server on `http://localhost:5000` with Nodemon, which automatically restarts on file changes.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    From the `frontend` directory, run:

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will start the Vite development server, and you can access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

-----

## üì¶ Building for Production

When you are ready to deploy your application, you need to create an optimized build of the frontend.

1.  **Build the Frontend App:**
    From the `frontend` directory, run:

    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```

    This will create a `dist` folder containing the optimized and minified static files for your application.

2.  **Start the Production Server:**
    The backend is already configured to serve the frontend's static files when in production. From the `backend` directory, run:

    ```shell
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the Node.js server, and we can access the complete application at the server's address (e.g., `http://localhost:5000`).
